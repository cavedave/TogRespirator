## Disclaimer

This is not a practical system yet. This is a project to investigate and research.

In particular these sorts of systems are not suitable for patients with an infectious disease. 
>'Aerosol generating procedures, such as noninvasive ventilation (NIV), high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), bag-mask ventilation, and intubation are of particularly high risk.'
