# TogRespirator

Science Hackday Dublin 2020 Respirator Project. Making a cheap respirator out of easily available components.


## Components

 - Stepper motor (NEMA17)
 - Laser cutter to fabricate linear actuator
 - Arduino (Uno) for motor control
 - Bag Valve Mask
 - Air pressure sensors (MPX5010). GY-63 could be a better choice

## Not yet implemented

 
 - Actuator callibrator
 - Air flow meter

## Disclaimer

This is not a practical system yet. This is a project in development for educational and research purposes.

In particular, these sort of systems may not be suitable for patients with an infectious disease.

For example;

>'Aerosol generating procedures, such as noninvasive ventilation (NIV), high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), bag-mask ventilation, and intubation are of particularly high risk.' <sup>1</sup>

>'...although exhaled air dispersion during high-flow nasal oxygen therapy and non-invasive ventilation via different interfaces is restricted, provided that there is a good mask interface fitting, not all hospitals around the world have access to such interfaces or enough personal-protective equipment of sufficiently high quality (ie, considered fit-tested particulate respirators, N95 or equivalent,
or higher level of protection) for aerosol-generating procedures, and several hospitals do not have a negative pressure isolation room.' <sup>2</sup>
